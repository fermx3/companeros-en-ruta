# LEARNINGS.md — Compañeros en Ruta

> Persistent log of non-obvious findings discovered during implementation.
> Append-only. Never delete; supersede.

---

## Purpose

Each entry captures a **surprise** — something that wasn't visible from the code/schema alone and that, if forgotten, would lead to repeated mistakes. The aim is to prevent the same trap from being hit twice.

**DO NOT** record:
- Things obvious from `packages/shared/src/types/database.ts`
- Style preferences (those go in `.claude/rules/coding-standards.md`)
- One-off ticket details
- Generic Next.js / Supabase facts

**DO** record:
- Schema quirks not captured by types (constraints, triggers, enum casts)
- RLS gotchas (recursion, helper-function dependencies, performance traps)
- Cross-table coupling that isn't enforced by FKs
- Hidden invariants enforced only by `validate_*` triggers
- Build/runtime traps (Next.js 16 + Turbopack quirks, RSC boundaries)
- Things that broke once and silently regressed

## Entry Format

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD — <Short title>

- **Context:** <Where this came up — file/route/migration>
- **Symptom:** <What went wrong / what was confusing>
- **Root cause:** <Why — the underlying invariant>
- **Fix / Rule:** <What to do next time>
- **Tags:** <#schema #rls #frontend #migration #auth #multi-tenant #performance ...>
```

Keep each section to 1–3 lines. Link to commits, files, or migrations when useful.

---

## Append Rules

1. **One entry per finding.** Don't bundle.
2. **Date in ISO format** (YYYY-MM-DD). Use today's actual date.
3. **Tag aggressively** so future agents can grep.
4. **Supersede, don't rewrite.** If a learning becomes wrong, add a new entry that says "supersedes <date> — <title>" and explains what changed. Leave the old entry in place.
5. **No PII, no secrets, no tenant data.** Anonymize tenant/brand/client names.
6. After appending, **read the previous 3 entries** to detect duplicate findings.

---

## How Future Agents Use This File

Before starting non-trivial work:

1. Identify the area you'll touch (auth, RLS, visits, QR, etc.).
2. `grep` LEARNINGS.md for relevant tags.
3. Apply the rules from any matching entries.
4. If you discover a contradiction with current state, supersede.

---

## Avoiding Repetition

A finding worth recording is worth **operationalizing**. After three entries on the same theme, promote the rule into:

- `.claude/rules/*.md` (a hard rule), or
- A skill page in `.claude/skills/*.md` (a pattern), or
- A lint / type-level check (best when feasible)

LEARNINGS.md is the staging ground; rules and skills are the canon.

### 2026-05-03 — CI baseline: 3 known-failing checks (lint, unit tests, E2E)

- **Context:** `.github/workflows/test.yml`. PR #11 (monorepo migration) surfaced these via the new pnpm/turbo pipeline. All three were failing on master too — the monorepo migration just made them visible because the workflow now runs cleanly up to those steps.
- **Symptom:** GH Actions fails 3 steps unless `continue-on-error: true` is set. None of them are runtime bugs; all three are infrastructure / test-isolation issues.
- **Root cause:** Three independent issues — see "Issues to fix" below.
- **Fix / Rule:** Until each is resolved, the steps stay marked `continue-on-error` so the workflow doesn't gate merges on pre-existing baseline failures. Vercel preview build is the de-facto gate. Each fix is tracked as its own task.

### Issues to fix (post-monorepo)

#### A. Lint — split into A1 (fixed) + A2 (open)

##### A1 — Services + admin user routes (FIXED 2026-05-03)

- **Status:** ✅ Fixed in PR #15.
- **What was fixed:**
  - Deleted `apps/web/src/lib/services/{visit,brand,qr}Service.ts` — these were dead code (zero callers). They referenced an old schema (`visit_number`, `start_time`, `visit_assessments`, `visit_purchases`) that no longer exists. Removing them resolved 12 of the 21 errors.
  - In `adminService.ts`: replaced 5 `as any` casts with `Tables['<X>']['Insert']` / `['Update']` types. Two of them (`user_profiles.preferences`, `tenants.settings`, `user_roles` insert with conditional `zone_id`) needed `as unknown as ...` to bridge a known supabase-js codegen quirk: generated `Json` types don't accept `Record<string, unknown>` at the type level even though they accept it at runtime.
  - In `apps/web/src/app/api/admin/users/{create,invite}/route.ts`: dropped the `(user: any)` annotation from a `.find` callback (the inferred type from `auth.admin.listUsers` is sufficient), and changed `let userWasCreatedNew` to `const` (`prefer-const`).
- **Result:** services + admin user routes scope is now lint-clean. 21 errors + 2 warnings → 0.

##### A2 — Project-wide lint baseline (OPEN)

- **Status:** ⏳ Open. ~241 errors + ~95 warnings remain across the rest of `apps/web/src/`.
- **Where:** components/, app/(dashboard)/, hooks/, lib/notifications.ts, lib/navigation-config.ts. Most are `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`, `prefer-const`, and `no-unused-vars`.
- **Why this wasn't part of A1:** The original LEARNINGS scope listed 21 specific errors in services + routes. The full project lint debt is much larger and was never a single deliverable. Splitting it explicitly so future agents don't think A is "done" when it isn't.
- **Fix approach:** tackle by directory in focused PRs:
  1. `lib/notifications.ts` + `lib/navigation-config.ts` (2 errors + 2 warnings)
  2. `app/api/**` route handlers (largest impact — server code)
  3. `app/(dashboard)/**` page components
  4. `components/**`
  5. `hooks/**`
- **Effort:** High when summed; each batch is 1–3h.
- **Severity:** Low (no runtime impact) but the gate stays off lint until done — meaning new lint regressions slip through.
- **Tracked in:** keep `continue-on-error: true` on the `Lint` step. Remove only when `pnpm --filter=@companeros/web exec eslint src/` returns 0 errors.

#### B. Unit tests — split into B1 (fixed) + B2 (open)

##### B1 — env-import crashes in CI (FIXED 2026-05-03)

- **Status:** ✅ Fixed in PR #13.
- **Cause:** `apps/web/src/lib/env.web.ts` calls `parseSharedEnv(...)` at module load. CI lacked `.env.local` so any module that transitively imported `@/lib/env` crashed at import → 5 test files never even loaded.
- **Fix:** `apps/web/jest.setup.js` now sets schema-valid dummies for all 6 env keys with the `||=` pattern, so local `.env.local` values still win when present.
- **Result:** CI baseline went from 21 fail / 103 pass / 123 total to 21 fail / 107 pass / 128 total — matches local exactly.

##### B2 — 21 stale unit tests (FIXED 2026-05-03 in PR #14)

- **Files affected (exact):** `__tests__/components/auth/login-form.test.tsx` (8 tests), `__tests__/app/(auth)/login/page.test.tsx` (4), `__tests__/components/layout/bottom-navigation.test.tsx` (2), `__tests__/components/ui/{action-button,request-card,status-badge,qr-action-card}.test.tsx` (mixed), `__tests__/integration/auth-flow.test.tsx` (1).
- **Cause:** Tests assert old Tailwind class names (e.g. `bg-green-100 text-green-700`). Components migrated to the **Perfectapp design system** (e.g. `bg-[#e3fee8] text-[#437b56]`) — see commit `3da420a` and the Perfectapp UI overhaul. Test assertions never updated.
- **Fix approach:** Update test assertions to match the new tokens. Where possible, assert on **semantic** outcomes (text content, role, aria-state) rather than class names — that prevents this kind of drift.
- **Effort:** Medium — ~21 assertions across 7 files. Mechanical but needs care to avoid asserting on internal styling that may change again.
- **Severity:** Medium. The components themselves are not broken; the tests are out of date and don't catch real regressions while they fail.
- **Tracked in:** unmark `continue-on-error: true` from the `Unit + integration tests (apps/web)` step once these are updated.

#### C. E2E Playwright — `next dev` fails to boot in CI without Supabase secrets

- **Cause:** `apps/web/playwright.config.ts` `webServer.command: 'next dev'` boots a real Next dev server, which validates env vars on boot. CI has no `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (the workflow references `secrets.SUPABASE_URL` / `secrets.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` but those aren't set in the GitHub repo's Secrets).
- **Fix approach (pick one):**
  1. **Recommended:** add `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` to GitHub repo Secrets (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions). Use a dedicated **test/staging** Supabase project — never production. Then E2E runs against that.
  2. **Alternative:** spin up a local Supabase via `supabase start` in CI before Playwright runs (heavier but no shared secrets). Requires `supabase` CLI in the runner.
  3. **Stopgap:** keep E2E `continue-on-error` and rely on Vercel preview manual smoke + local runs.
- **Decision needed:** is it OK to expose a non-prod Supabase project's anon key + URL to GitHub Actions? Anon key is already public-facing, so this is normally fine, but tenant data should be a sanitized test set.
- **Effort:** Low (#1, once a test project exists), High (#2).
- **Severity:** Medium-high. No automated regression coverage for full user flows. Manual smoke + Vercel preview cover this for now.
- **Tracked in:** unmark `continue-on-error: true` from `E2E tests` step once fixed.
