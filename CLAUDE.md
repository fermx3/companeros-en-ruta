# CLAUDE.md

## Project Context — Compañeros en Ruta

This repository contains a **production-grade, multi-tenant SaaS** built with **Next.js (App Router)** and **Supabase** as the backend platform. The system is architected around **strict database-driven design**, with **PostgreSQL + Row Level Security (RLS)** as the core enforcement layer for multi-tenancy and access control.

This file defines **non-negotiable rules** for how Claude must operate when working in this repository.

---

## 🚨 NON‑NEGOTIABLE RULES (READ FIRST)

### 1. Schema Truth & No Guessing

* You **MUST NOT assume** any table, column, type, relation, policy, view, function, or enum.
* You **MUST base all schema-dependent work** on the **current project state**, using the following hierarchy:

  1. **`src/lib/types/database.ts`** — Primary reference for column names, field types, and relationships when writing TypeScript code (frontend/API)
  2. **Versioned migrations in this repo** — Authoritative for DDL, structural understanding, and schema history
  3. **Local Supabase Postgres instance (Docker)** — Runtime verification, built from migrations
  4. **Hosted Supabase DB** — Final production checks when needed

The working assumption for this repository is:

* The schema is controlled via migrations.
* No one is changing the database structure outside this repository.
* The types file (`src/lib/types/database.ts`) maps 1:1 to the DB schema and is kept in sync with migrations.
* Therefore, the **types file + migrations + local Supabase DB** represent the **most current schema** when kept in sync.

For **TypeScript code tasks** (queries, data access, API routes, components), consulting the types file is sufficient for column/field verification.

For **structural changes** (DDL, new tables, RLS, migrations), you must verify against migrations and/or the local DB.

If you have not verified the schema from **at least one of these sources**, you are operating on invalid assumptions.

**DO NOT PROCEED.**

---

### 2. Connection Policy (Local-First, Remote When Needed)

You **MUST NOT perform full database dumps repeatedly**.

#### Default workflow: Local-first

You **MUST** use one of these as the default verification sources:

* **Supabase CLI + local Supabase (Docker)** (preferred)
* **Local PostgreSQL connection** to the Supabase Docker DB

#### Remote Supabase connection

A direct connection to the hosted Supabase project is **NOT required for every task**.

You **MUST connect to the hosted Supabase project** only when:

* the task is explicitly about **remote-only resources** (e.g., Edge Functions deployed state, storage buckets configuration, auth settings, project settings)
* you are about to **ship** database changes and need a **final verification** against the hosted project
* there is evidence of **schema drift** (local vs remote mismatch) or uncertainty

Credentials may be used **only to establish connections** — never as a source of schema truth.

#### Available database scripts

For local database management, the following scripts are available:

* **Import local backup**: `bash ./scripts/import_local_backup.sh` - Imports code/data to the local database
* **Export remote backup**: `bash ./scripts/export_remote_backup.sh` - Exports data from remote database

#### If connection or sync fails

If you cannot confirm schema from migrations/local DB **or** cannot complete a required remote verification:

* ❌ Do NOT guess
* ❌ Do NOT simulate schema
* ❌ Do NOT continue implementation

Instead:

1. Stop immediately
2. Explain **why** verification failed
3. Provide **exact, actionable steps** to restore verification (local sync and/or remote access)

**DO NOT CONTINUE UNTIL VERIFICATION IS RESTORED.**

---

## 🗄️ REQUIRED DB SNAPSHOT (ONLY WHEN SCHEMA / RLS IS IMPACTED)

When a task impacts database structure or access control, you **MUST base decisions on a verified snapshot**.

**Fast path (no DDL impact):** If the task only involves reading/writing existing columns (no schema changes), consulting `src/lib/types/database.ts` is sufficient. A full DB snapshot is not required.

### Preferred sources (in order)

1. **`src/lib/types/database.ts`** (fast-path for TypeScript code tasks)
2. **Repo migrations** (authoritative history)
3. **Local Supabase DB (Docker)** built from migrations (authoritative current state)
4. **Hosted Supabase DB** (verification when needed)

### Minimum required understanding:

* Tables
* Columns
* Column types
* Views

### Additionally (only if relevant, no overkill):

* Foreign keys / relationships
* RLS policies
* Functions and triggers
* Enums and extensions

### Output rule

* You are **not required** to print a full schema dump.
* Only surface the relevant portion of the snapshot **when it impacts the proposed change**.
* Your solution **must be derived from verified sources above**.

---

## 🧱 DATABASE CHANGES POLICY (MIGRATION-FIRST)

* **All database changes MUST be implemented via migrations**
* Manual or implicit changes are not acceptable

### Local-first change workflow

When proposing database changes, you should assume this workflow:

1. Create / update **versioned migrations** in the repo
2. Apply them to the **local Supabase DB (Docker)**
3. Validate behavior locally (including RLS implications)
4. If the change is destined for production, perform a **final remote verification** step as required

### If you cannot apply migrations yourself

* Provide the **exact SQL migration** required
* Clearly explain **why** you cannot apply it

### Retro-documentation rule

If changes are detected that were made previously without migrations:

* You **MUST retro-document them** into proper migrations
* This must happen **before any new changes** are introduced

---

## 🔐 SECURITY RULES

* Never hardcode secrets
* Never log credentials or tokens
* Prefer local, least-privilege authentication methods
* Treat all tenant data as sensitive
* Never weaken or bypass RLS for convenience

Multi-tenancy isolation is a **hard requirement**, not an optimization.

---

## ⚠️ COMMON SCHEMA PITFALLS (MUST READ)

These are **frequently confused field names** that cause runtime errors. **ALWAYS** use the correct column names listed below.

### user_profiles table

| ❌ WRONG | ✅ CORRECT | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| `auth_user_id` | `user_id` | Links to `auth.users.id` |
| `full_name` | `first_name`, `last_name` | Concatenate for display: `${first_name} ${last_name}` |

**Query example:**
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('user_profiles')
  .select('tenant_id, first_name, last_name')
  .eq('user_id', user.id)  // NOT auth_user_id!
  .single()
```

### visits table

| ❌ WRONG | ✅ CORRECT | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| `status` | `visit_status` | Enum: `visit_status_enum`. Frontend maps it to `status` for convenience |

**Query example:**
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('visits')
  .select('id, visit_status, promotor_id')
  .eq('visit_status', 'in_progress')  // NOT status!
  .eq('promotor_id', userProfile.id)
```

### orders table

| ❌ WRONG | ✅ CORRECT | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| `status` | `order_status` | Enum: `order_status_enum` |

**Query example:**
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('orders')
  .select('id, order_number, order_status, total_amount')
  .eq('order_status', 'pending')  // NOT status!
```

### visit_orders table

| ❌ WRONG | ✅ CORRECT | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| `status` | `order_status` | Enum: `visit_order_status_enum` |

**Query example:**
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('visit_orders')
  .select('id, order_number, order_status')
  .eq('visit_id', visitId)
  .eq('order_status', 'draft')  // NOT status!
```

### TypeScript Types — Primary Code Reference

`src/lib/types/database.ts` is the **primary source of truth** for column names and types when writing TypeScript code.

**Before writing any Supabase query or data access code**, consult this file for correct field names.

Always import and use types from `@/lib/types/database`:

```typescript
import type { UserProfile, Order, VisitOrder, VisitStageAssessment } from '@/lib/types/database'
```

**Maintenance rule**: When a migration adds, renames, or removes columns, the corresponding types in `src/lib/types/database.ts` **MUST be updated in the same commit**. Failing to do so creates drift between the schema and the codebase.

You are operating in the following environment:

### Frontend

* Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack)
* React 19
* TypeScript (strict)
* Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui
* Zod, React Hook Form, Recharts, date-fns

### Backend / Platform

* Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Realtime, Edge Functions)
* supabase-js v2
* supabase-ssr

### Architecture

* Multi-tenant SaaS
* Tenants → Brands → Users / Zones / Clients
* RLS enforced on **all tables**

You must respect:

* Server Components vs Client Components boundaries
* Server Actions data access patterns
* RLS-aware querying at all times

---

## 🧪 QUALITY GATES (MANDATORY)

Before considering any change complete, the solution must be compatible with:

* Linting
* Type checking
* Unit / integration tests
* Build process

If a proposal would break any of these, you must surface it explicitly.

---

## ⛔ BLOCKING CONDITIONS

You must **STOP IMMEDIATELY** if:

* The database schema cannot be verified
* RLS implications are unclear
* A change risks cross-tenant data leakage
* A migration cannot be validated

In these cases, explain the blocker and propose a safe resolution path.

---

## 🧭 MAINTENANCE OF THIS FILE

If architectural decisions change (database strategy, auth model, tenancy rules):

* This file **must be updated first**
* Code changes should follow only after alignment

When in doubt:

> **Inspect the database first.**

---

## FINAL DIRECTIVE

You are expected to behave as a **senior production engineer**.

Accuracy, safety, and verification are mandatory.

Speed without certainty is failure.
